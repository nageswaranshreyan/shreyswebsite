description: 
- Developed a comprehensive research project, which involved the use of machine learning models such as a Decision Tree Regressor and a Poisson Distribution, to predict National Football League scores. 
- The project was further extended to see if these models can place more accurate predictions by creating model-derived win probabilities and comparing them against those from leading bookmakers.
- Achieved a mark of 79, placing in the distinction category.
